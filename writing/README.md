# Writing Project Structure

This directory contains your writing projects organized as follows:

- **ideas/**: Initial concepts, seeds of inspiration, and brainstorming notes
- **drafts/**: Works in progress and ongoing writing projects
- **final/**: Completed and polished pieces ready for sharing or publication
- **resources/**: Research materials, references, and supporting documents
- **archive/**: Previous versions and older projects worth keeping

## Usage Tips

- Use the `ideas/` directory to quickly capture new concepts before they slip away
- Move work to `drafts/` when you begin developing an idea into something more substantial 
- Only move completed work to `final/` when it's ready for others to read
- Store research materials in `resources/` with clear filenames

## Version Control with Git

- Use `git add <filename>` to stage changes for specific files
- Commit your work regularly with `git commit -m "Brief description of changes"`
- Create branches with `git branch <branch-name>` for experimental writing or major revisions
- Switch between branches using `git checkout <branch-name>`
- Pull updates from shared repositories with `git pull origin main` 
- Push your changes to share with others using `git push origin <branch-name>`
- Create pull requests for feedback before finalizing major pieces
- Use `archive/` to keep track of your writing journey and past iterations
